/// Words that should be considered optional when found in the query.  By default, records must match all words in the
/// search query to be included in the search results. Adding optional words can help to increase the number of search
/// results by running an additional search query that doesn't include the optional words. For example, if the search
/// query is \"action video\" and \"video\" is an optional word, the search engine runs two queries. One for \"action
/// video\" and one for \"action\". Records that match all words are ranked higher.  For a search query with 4 or more
/// words **and** all its words are optional, the number of matched words required for a record to be included in the
/// search results increases for every 1,000 records:  - If `optionalWords` has less than 10 words, the required number
/// of matched words increases by 1:   results 1 to 1,000 require 1 matched word, results 1,001 to 2000 need 2 matched
/// words. - If `optionalWords` has 10 or more words, the number of required matched words increases by the number of
/// optional words divided by 5 (rounded down).   For example, with 18 optional words: results 1 to 1,000 require 1
/// matched word, results 1,001 to 2000 need 4 matched words.  For more information, see [Optional words](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/empty-or-insufficient-results/#creating-a-list-of-optional-words).
